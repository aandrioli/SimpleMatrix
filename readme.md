# SimpleMatrix

This project is made for educational purposes for my students. It is in no way a serious attempt to make a matrix 
library. So, if you are looking for such a serious lib, keep looking ... (sorry!)

It provides a template class with the most basic matrix operations (addition, transpose, product, hadamard product). 
I've not worried about how efficient or quick the operations are.
